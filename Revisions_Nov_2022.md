CHANGES MADE
- Minor style nit - expand IAM in the first usage in the second paragraph
- Expand “RP” on first usage in the first bullet starting with “in a Distributed System”
- Add “aka IDP” after “the Identity Provider” in the first bullet
- In the Terminology section I don’t fully understand what it means to have a check mark (this might become more clear as I read further). [added further explantion]
- The sentence before Trust Root subsection… maybe add a sentence as to why the system developer is aware of the situation?
- Governance section - an additional sentence or two to provide an example of Governance could be good…. Or reference the Policy section in the User Provisioning doc? [added forward reference to access governance, which has more detail]
- Credential Services - I think expanding this slight to explain what binding is, or more accurately, to what the credential is bound would be helpful. [Added text to clarify]
- Authentication and Session Section - 1st figure: it is not clear why the arrows point in both directions for either Session Management or AuthN Delegation. At the very least the arrow ought to point from RP to IDM for AuthN [Added text to explain why double arrows are used.]

CHANGES NOT MADE
- Personal nit - Seeing “The IDM is used for X” grates me the wrong way… I’d prefer  “The IDM system is used for X” [decline since the definition can be plugged in directly as in used by the set of policies, procedures,....]
- I’d love a more expansive definition of authentication to include something to the tune of “validating that the entity presenting a credential today was the same one presenting it in the past” [Authentication definition is not here only AuthN / Assertion.  The comment is valid and the definition in the main Terminology section is could be improved by it.]
